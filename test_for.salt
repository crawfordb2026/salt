# Array Operations
make int array scores[4]
make scores[0] 85
make scores[1] 92
make scores[2] 78
make scores[3] 96

print "Student Scores:"
make int i 0
loop i from 0 to 3
{
    print "Student " i + 1 ": " scores[i]
}

# Calculate average
make double total 0.0
make int j 0
loop j from 0 to 3
{
    make total total + scores[j]
}
make double average total / 4.0
